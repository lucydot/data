|      For optimal performance we recommend to set                            |
|        NCORE= 4 - approx SQRT( number of cores)                             |
|      NCORE specifies how many cores store one orbital (NPAR=cpu/NCORE).     |
|      This setting can  greatly improve the performance of VASP for DFT.     |
|      The default, NPAR=number of cores might be grossly inefficient         |
|      on modern multi-core architectures or massively parallel machines.     |
|      Do your own testing !!!!                                               |
|      Unfortunately you need to use the default for GW and RPA calculations. |
|      (for HF NCORE is supported but not extensively tested yet)             |
|                                                                             |

|      You have enabled k-point parallelism (KPAR>1).                         |
|      This developmental code was originally  written by Paul Kent at ORNL,  |
|      and carefully double checked in Vienna.                                |
|      GW as well as linear response parallelism added by Martijn Marsman     |
|      and Georg Kresse.                                                      |
|      Carefully verify results versus KPAR=1.                                |
|      Report problems to Paul Kent and Vienna.                               |

|      You have selected ISYM=2 for HF type calculation. This will symmetrize |
|      the charge density but not the exchange potential.                     |
|      I suggest to use ISYM=3 instead. This uses symmetry to obtain          |
|      the orbitals at all k-points in the Brillouine zone, but does not      |
|      apply symmetry to the Hartree potential directly.                      |
|      The resultant charge might have lower symmetry than the crystal,       |
|      but at least, Hartree and exchange are fully compatible.               |
|                                                                             |

|      Your generating k-point grid is not commensurate to the symmetry       |
|      of the lattice.  This can cause   slow convergence with respect        |
|      to k-points for HF type calculations                                   |

|       ) if not already the case, use automatic k-point generation           |
|       ) shift your grid to Gamma (G) (e.g. required for hex or fcc lattice) |
|                                                                             |
