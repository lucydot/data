|      You have enabled k-point parallelism (KPAR>1).                         |
|      This developmental code was originally  written by Paul Kent at ORNL,  |
|      and carefully double checked in Vienna.                                |
|      GW as well as linear response parallelism added by Martijn Marsman     |
|      and Georg Kresse.                                                      |
|      Carefully verify results versus KPAR=1.                                |
|      Report problems to Paul Kent and Vienna.                               |

|      The number of bands has been changed from the values supplied          |
|      in the INCAR file. This is a result of running the parallel version.   |
|      The orbitals not found in the WAVECAR file will be initialized with    |
|      random numbers, which is usually adequate. For correlated              |
|      calculations, however, you should redo the groundstate calculation.    |
|      I found NBANDS    =       50  now  NBANDS  =      52                   |
